Andrew Cuomo signed what the state called \u201csweeping\u201d legislation to reform the state\u2019s foreclosure process and address the state\u2019s issues with zombie homes.\nAccording to Cuomo\u2019s office, the legislation combats the blight of vacant and abandoned properties by expediting the rehabilitation, repair and improvement of these properties, and enables the state to assist homeowners facing mortgage foreclosure.\nAdditionally, the new laws will also impose a pre-foreclosure duty on banks and servicers to maintain zombie homes, creates an electronic registry of abandoned properties, and expedites foreclosure for vacant and abandoned properties to get them back on the market.\nNow, the state is going a step further.\nEarlier this week, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced a new program that will help New York\u2019s city governments track and address zombie homes in their respective cities.\nAccording to Schneiderman\u2019s office, the Zombie Remediation and Prevention Initiative will provide $13 million in grants to local governments to fight zombie homes.\nSchneiderman\u2019s office said the money will be awarded via a \u201ccompetitive\u201d application process.\nAccording to Schneiderman\u2019s office, the 100 cities with the greatest problem of zombies and vacancy are invited to apply for the funds.\nThe money will address housing vacancy and blight by bolstering municipalities\u2019 capacity for housing code enforcement, for tracking and monitoring vacant properties, and for legal enforcement capacity to ensure banks and mortgage companies comply with local and state law, Schneiderman\u2019s office stated.\nSchneiderman\u2019s office added that the grants also require communities to develop \u201cinnovative\u201d programs and policies and connect at-risk homeowners to services so they can avoid foreclosure and stay in their homes.\nAccording to Schneiderman\u2019s office, the grant program will be funded by money received by the state from Morgan Stanley as part of the company\u2019s $3.2 billion settlement for \u201cdeceptive\u201d mortgage bond practices, which was announced in February.\nThis isn\u2019t the only housing program that New York is funding using the Morgan Stanley settlement.\nEarlier this month, New York City announced plans to launch a \u201cfirst of its kind\u201d program to buy a number of delinquent loans from the Federal Housing Administration as part of an effort to keep struggling homeowners from losing their homes to foreclosure.\nThe cost of that program is $13 million, and $2.9 million of that is coming from the Morgan Stanley settlement.\nAs for this latest effort to fight zombie homes, Schneiderman\u2019s office said that the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, a national community development intermediary that specializes in affordable housing, economic development, and community revitalization, is running the grant program.\nAccording to Schneiderman\u2019s office, LISC selected the grantees for this program based on the number of abandoned properties within the municipality; the proportion of such properties compared to the overall size of the municipality; and its level of general economic distress.\nAdditionally, all invitees must have populations of at least 5,000 residents and at least 100 vacant and abandoned properties.\nLISC expects to award grants in amounts ranging from $75,000 to $350,000, depending on the size of the municipality, the scope of its zombie problem, and its track record and capacity for addressing such issues, Schneiderman\u2019s office stated.", "source": "redpajama", "version": "v1", "added": "2023-04-23T06:24:03.251Z", "created": "2019-04-19T17:25:14.000Z", "metadata": {"timestamp": "2019-04-19T17:25:14Z", "url": "https://www.housingwire.com/articles/37604-new-york-unveils-13-million-program-for-cities-fight-against-zombie-homes", "language": "en", "source": "c4", "length": 562}, "subdomain": "c4"}

Supposedly taking place roughly in October/November of 1960, Don makes this pitch after he is asked to come up with a new advertising angle for Kodak\u2019s \u2018Wheel\u2019 projector. The pitch is made towards the end of the episode and is inspired by a late encounter between Don and Harry where they speak about the latent power of photography and the power behind each photo.\nDon has to make a pitch to the executives at Kodak that will allow them to sell the \u2018wheel\u2019, as it is known up to this point, that spins around on the top of the slide projector and allows you to show one slide after another. They see this wheel as an exciting new technology; in an era of excitement over new technologies. It is a time when people are being launched into space, huge advances are being made in science and medicine and American optimism is riding high on a wave of consumer confidence and affluence. The challenge is how to market the oldest technology that exists? How to market something as a technological breakthrough when it also represents something that was mastered thousands of years ago?\nThe key to Don\u2019s presentation is the power of nostalgia. Don creates a beautiful twist when pitching this advert. He creates a relationship with the Kodak executives, he shows photos of himself and his family in the past, while also verbally seducing the executives and the audience in the pitch.\nThe carousel scene made such an impression. Shown towards the end of season 1, it encapsulates not only the themes and storylines of every character in the first season, but also the different layers that the series taught us to look out for.\nViewed in the cold light of day, this scene can be viewed merely as dramatic schmaltz (albeit of a very high calibre) or brilliant television; one of those rare moments in the best television dramas which demonstrate what can be done when real talent is harnessed. The viewers of Mad Men \u2018buy\u2019 the scene for its straightforward, raw emotional power, or they choose to see it as the ultimate on-screen manipulation.", "source": "redpajama", "version": "v1", "added": "2023-04-23T08:11:11.197Z", "created": "2019-04-24T21:58:56.000Z", "metadata": {"timestamp": "2019-04-24T21:58:56Z", "url": "https://browsedigital.com/journal/mad-men-the-carousel/", "language": "en", "source": "c4", "length": 421}, "subdomain": "c4"}

This, from Clusterstock.\nAccording to CNBC\u2019s Steve Liesman, the SEC has evidence that contradicts its own argument that ACA was mislead on the nature of John Paulson\u2019s intent.\nSpecifically, in interviewing Paulson lieutenant Paolo Pellegrini, ACA was informed that Paulson intended to go short the CDO.\nNot surprisingly, this was left out of the SEC complaint.\nThe SEC really needs to answer for this.\nRemember always, this is a PR fight. Certainly at this juncture. And in any PR fight, you want to get your story out as if it\u2019s not from you, but channeled through some independent \"news\" source. CNBC could not provide a better venue. They\u2019re naturally sympathetic to your side to begin with, and they\u2019ll funnel any \"news\" you want through their mouth\u2019s. And Clusterstock\u2026.well, judge on your own, all I\u2019ll say is they rarely meet an attack on Goldman that they don\u2019t seek to diminish.\nLook, this might be an accurate account, the SEC is certainly not above reproach, to say the least. But it just reads like a calculated PR offensive. Paulson\u2019s lietenent saying ACA knew? Is he exactly unimpeachable? Doesn\u2019t he have every incentive in the world to just say this? He can easily couch that as his understanding, that ACA was informed. Perhaps Fall Guy Fab forgot to tell ACA, we don\u2019t know, neither does Paulo.\nHere\u2019s another way to look at it. The SEC has this info, it it becomes demonstrable fact that ACA knew Paulson was shorting it, it clearly destroys their case. Whatever SEC\u2019s motivations are here, they\u2019re not bringing a case out that will get shot down that simply. So I suspect the \"ACA Knew\" defense is a \"he said, she said\" thing. You can\u2019t prove a negative, i.e., you can\u2019t prove ACA didn\u2019t know. But you can prove they did know if there\u2019s some evidence that shows they were informed.

There are two key points to consider when benchmarking: cost and utilization.\nOne benchmark that explores both costs and utilization is the total cost of laundry and linen replacement, or if rented, linen rental costs vs. total patient days and/or adjusted patient days. Patient days should be less than $8.50 and adjusted patient days less than $6.50.\nBreaking it down further, benchmarking for total pounds being processed will provide utilization numbers. Total pounds (clean) divided by patient days should be less than 15 and adjusted patient days less than 12.\nFinally, are you paying the right price? Competition is the best way to evaluate this number. While some hospitals achieve even lower rates, the optimal cost/lb. of laundry and linen rental should be less than $0.44/lb.\nTo truly understand linen costs, your hospital can form a Linen Committee. It will be the Linen Committee's responsibility to explore any linen related issues, as well as propose and implement solutions. The committee will also be in charge of creating and reviewing linen policies and processes such as bed linen changes, linen discard, centralized linen, OSHA contaminated linen guidelines, staff education, and linen theft control.\nThe committee should consist of front line works who work with linen products every day. The committee should also receive additional hospital support to meet the cost reduction goals.\nHospitals must provide certain staff with scrubs to eliminate the risk of infections. It is important to have guidelines and controls set up to monitor your scrubs. Whether an extensive valet system or a simple policy, you can determine who in the organization is wearing scrubs.\nHaving systems in place can help track and benchmark scrubs that are being stolen, trashed, or even hoarded. This data combined with your controls and staff education can help you manage your linen costs.", "source": "redpajama", "version": "v1", "added": "2023-04-23T06:30:27.635Z", "created": "2019-04-21T12:44:14.000Z", "metadata": {"timestamp": "2019-04-21T12:44:14Z", "url": "https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/washing-out-unnecessary-linen-costs.html", "language": "en", "source": "c4", "length": 348}, "subdomain": "c4"}

Her conception of a radical ethics and aesthetics could be characterized as a new poetics of species, forcing a rethinking of the body's significance, both human and animal. Exploring the \"logic of flesh\" and the use of the body to mark species identity, Anat Pick reimagines a poetics that begins with the vulnerability of bodies, not the omnipotence of thought. Pick proposes a \"creaturely\" approach based on the shared embodiedness of humans and animals and a postsecular perspective on human-animal relations. She turns to literature, film, and other cultural texts, challenging the familiar inventory of the human: consciousness, language, morality, and dignity. Reintroducing Weil's elaboration of such themes as witnessing, commemoration, and collective memory, Pick identifies the animal within all humans, emphasizing the corporeal and its issues of power and freedom. In her poetics of the creaturely, powerlessness is the point at which aesthetic and ethical thinking must begin.", "source": "redpajama", "version": "v1", "added": "2023-04-23T07:43:42.109Z", "created": "2019-04-26T02:22:17.000Z", "metadata": {"timestamp": "2019-04-26T02:22:17Z", "url": "https://www.beck-shop.de/pick-creaturely-poetics/product/9130145?campaign=webcode&utm_source=offline&utm_medium=webcode&utm_campaign=print-stuff&pac=weco_sem", "language": "en", "source": "c4", "length": 180}, "subdomain": "c4"}

No Dany, no Dorne, no Littlefinger, no Pycelle, but this episode had enough going on. Despite my criticisms of Jon\u2019s revival, I thought the episode did a good job building on last week in establishing the season\u2019s storylines. The Huffington Post\u2019s Bill Bradley put out an article on Wednesday claiming to have a \u201cnew\u201d Game of Thrones theory regarding the parentage of Jon Snow and Meera Reed. Without even clicking on a single link, I see one from asoiaf. esteros. rg from 2012. I doubt that\u2019s the oldest either. The site has been praised by many for ushering in the modern day era of the news. While there\u2019s plenty of truth to that, things like this thievery aren\u2019t just a disgrace, they\u2019re sad. You have a guy who pretends they don\u2019t even exist and that he\u2019s the first to make this groundbreaking revelation. Articles like these are cash cows, especially when the research only takes a three-word Google search. I\u2019ve featured many of them here in my \u201cInterviews of Ice and Fire\u201d feature. I wouldn\u2019t want to go through the trouble of finding someone to answer his questions for him. They\u2019re the reason why genuinely new theories are still being discovered years after the last book in the main series was released. Without them, Huffington Post and Buzzfeed would have no one to steal from. Beyond that, they\u2019re not difficult to get ahold of. If they answer my tweets and e-mails, I imagine they\u2019d respond to requests for paid freelance work. There used to be a code that journalists abided by.

Directed by Mike Flanagan, Hush is an inventive Horror film with a simple twist that changes everything. Dressed with absolutely breathtaking cinematography ala Dario Argento \u2019s 1977 masterpiece Suspiria, The Neon Demon is an obscure look at the vanity of beauty in culture. One that will stick with the audience days after viewing, The Neon Demon is a must watch. In this film, a mother and her two daughters find a Ouija board. Initially, they thought the board would give their business better aesthetic appeal, but they soon realize that the board is more. Seeing Director Mike Flanagan make the list twice, Ouija: Origin of Evil will spook the socks off of anyone who considers themselves a Horror movie lover. A collaborative, twisted Horror anthology, which takes the viewer on a trip into purgatory with hell lurking on the outskirts. Those destined to go southbound, there is no escaping their past, or the monsters in the distance, and this film is a marvelous look at such. After Michelle hears some strange news reports on her car\u2019s radio, she gets into a car accident that leaves her unconscious. She wakes up injured and locked in bunker room underground with only the intimidating Howard and sweet handyman Emmitt to explain to her that a deadly toxin has been mysteriously released in the air aboveground, possibly making them the last people left alive on Earth. The twists and turns in this tightly woven Psychological Mystery make for an intense, nail-biting thrill ride. An English farmer and his family are banished to a desolate patch of land, adjacent to a creepy forest after their religious beliefs are questioned by their village leaders. When their infant son goes missing, the family starts to unravel and turn on each other as this psychologically based Horror movie unfolds.

You won\u2019t be doing much customizing or adding to your content with YouTube TV \u2014 there are currently only four add-on channels available: Showtime, Fox Soccer Plus, Shudder, and Sundance Now. YouTube TV also falls a bit short in its device support, especially compared to the services we\u2019ve previously covered. If you have a Google Home device and a Chromecast, YouTube TV can be controlled with voice commands via Google Assistant. Similarly, Google Assistant can even inform you of what content is currently saved to your DVR. Compared to the other services here, Amazon Prime\u2019s channel add-ons don\u2019t pose much competition. Prime simply offers a small number of channels supported currently by just Fire TV. For Amazon Fire TV users (no coincidence that it requires an in-house device), a small selection of these channels can be browsed via a \u201cLive Now\u201d menu, which includes a programming guide so you can see what\u2019s on next. As of this writing, only a small number of premium channels \u2014 including HBO, Cinemax, Starz, and Showtime \u2014 will show up on the \u201clive now\u201d section, and only if you\u2019re subscribed to them through Amazon Prime\u2019s \u201cChannels. \ufffd\ufffd The number is growing, however, and we\u2019re hopeful for a more varied selection in the near future. A perk to a setup like this is that it will directly integrate into Amazon\u2019s growing ecosystem of connected devices. That means you\u2019ll be able to check what\u2019s on the premium Prime add-on channels just by talking to Alexa. That feature might not be a game changer, but it\u2019s helpful nonetheless, and only serves to strengthen the case for subscribing to these channels if you\u2019re an Amazon Prime member not subscribed to them elsewhere. For now, this isn\u2019t quite an option for supplanting a subscription to Sling, PS Vue, etc. but it is a worthwhile Prime feature that will hopefully continue to grow and evolve. Like the other services on this list, it\u2019s become a solution for those who want easy access to a library of both live and on-demand content \u2014 everything from TV series, to movies, to popular internet content creators. Unlike the others, however, Pluto TV is entirely free. No, really. For the cool price of zero dollars a month, Pluto TV will provide you access to select content from more than 40 live channels, including CNBC, MSNBC, Sky News, movie channels, and live sports, plus 15 music-streaming channels. Users will also enjoy a library of on-demand content.\nW, jaki sposob na smartfonie lenovo tb3 8 plus tb-8703f rozegram gre reversi - midas interactive entertainment.

Within the charcoal broiler, the mouse continued to crouch, motionless except for the quiver. The parted lips were very red and Rich had once almost asked if it was lipstick. And the mouse began to run, feet ticking against the metal floor. He struck the match and dropped it into the broiler. The gas burst aflame with a quick, hollow wind sound. The ticking speeded as the mouse scampered in circles squeaking. Rich expected Allen to remark about the effectiveness of the warming process, for the grey animal no longer shivered. The trio stood in a circle around the charcoal burner and stared at the corpse. He sat up in bed and leaned against the sill to look out. He saw it against the lighter darkness of the street and it disappeared when the street no longer lay behind it. Rich rose slowly, careful not to let the squeaking bed springs make too much noise. It looked white, though hidden in the shadow of Rich's bed. He knelt beside it, opened his pajama shirt and touched the key. He bent low over the box so that the key would reach the padlock without being removed from around his neck. He pushed it inward slowly, so that the sound would come as individual clicks, not as a quick loud rachet. Rich removed the lock and opened the box and took something out and tiptoed to the window. There, in the dim moonlight, he stared at the picture. He could also see white-coated sheep huddled around the man. He could not see the single sheep that the man held close because it was white like the robe.\nA browser. The tool is available for Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Opera.

Among other projects, AbualSameed works with Supporting Our Youth\u2019s program for young queer immigrants. But when organizers found gay content in his bio, they tried to get him to call off his presentation.\n\u201cI am still shocked that in this day and age, in a city like Toronto, I am faced with such acts of ignorance and institutionalized homophobia and discrimination,\u201d AbualSameed wrote in a letter to friends.\nAbualSameed and Mary Anne Chambers, Ontario Minister Of Colleges, Training And Universities, were engaged through a speakers\u2019 bureau called Passages To Canada, run by the Dominion Institute. The school did not receive any biographical information about the speakers until the morning of the event. That\u2019s when Dominion Institute project manager Tina Edan woke up to panicked telephone messages from Allan Mac- Millan, a teacher at St Dunstan.\nEdan says MacMillan told her the elementary school was concerned that AbualSameed\u2019s bio indicated he worked with gay youth, and therefore was likely gay himself.\nEdan wasn\u2019t able to reach AbualSameed so he arrived at the school not knowing about the controversy. He was immediately taken to meet prinicipal Anne-Marie Cassin and informed that he wasn\u2019t welcome to speak about homosexuality.\n\u201cI could see that what they were looking for was for me to be offended and get out of the whole thing.

Any mention in the social media is a form of free advertising for the celebrity or business, so there are a large number of social media marketing agencies.\nIt is advisable to initially purchase a low value social media marketing package for followers for social media accounts, to check the effectiveness. Many agencies are offering low cost packages, costing between $1-$5 for a large number of followers , which are extremely affordable compared to PPC marketing using google adwords, where the cost of a single click can be $1 or more for some keywords.\nIt is also important to update the social media account regularly with fresh high quality content, so that it is tracked closely. The mainstream media like newspapers are closely monitoring the social media accounts of celebrities, high profile individuals and organizations.\nThe growth and profit of a business depends to a very large extent on the sales of the business, so businesses are looking for marketing methods which will actually increase the sales of a business.\nWhile there are many digital marketing agencies which promise to increase the number of visitors to a website , king kong online marketing promises to increase the number of sales for a business using their services.

Maybe not.\nTruth is, Notre Dame has already been digitally scanned in great detail by an American art historian named Andrew Tallon. Several years ago, the Vassar College professor used cutting-edge laser scanners to capture over a billion points of data that, when combined in suitable software, can be used to create a 3-D model of the cathedral.\nTallon, who died last year, learned a lot from his scanning exercise\u2014and so did the people running the church. His models revealed that Notre Dame was crumbling to an extent that its administrators had not fully appreciated, and that urgent restoration work was needed to maintain its structural integrity.\nA restoration project began last year and, although investigations are still underway, there is reportedly a suspicion that Monday\u2019s fire was accidentally caused in the course of that rehab.\nPresident Emmanuel Macron has pledged to restore Notre Dame, the main structure of which appears to have survived the blaze. Donations are pouring in from billionaires and others, and French construction groups are also eager to pitch in. But could Tallon\u2019s data help the reconstruction effort?\nAccording to Lindsay Cook, visiting assistant professor at Vassar\u2019s art department, the architects involved in the restoration project that was underway had probably already studied the building carefully. She also noted comments by the chief architect, Benjamin Mouton, that suggested it would be \u201calmost impossible\u201d to create a perfect copy\u2014for one thing, these days there are no oak forests comparable to those that supplied Notre Dame\u2019s beams back in the 12th century.\nAssistance might also be available from another source\u2014a project called Inception that receives funding from the European Commission and was highlighted in last week\u2019s announcement about the digitization of European heritage sites.\nInception is run by Roberto Di Giulio of the University of Ferrara in Italy. As Di Giulio explained to Fortune, the project is developing a new way to translate point clouds, such as that compiled by Vassar\u2019s Tallon, into the type of Building Information Modeling (BIM) file that architects can use in their work, or that can be used to present a building in a virtual-reality context. A big part of the Commission\u2019s digitization push is to give citizens new ways to engage with heritage sites.\nThis technique is rather novel, as BIM models are based on standardized building elements that can be arranged in virtual form by an architect, and the elements of monumental old buildings are anything but standardized. Di Giulio said artificial intelligence will ultimately be required to learn about and virtually recreate all the types of objects that went into a gothic building, for example. But Inception\u2019s system could still prove useful in the case of Notre Dame, he said.", "source": "redpajama", "version": "v1", "added": "2023-04-23T06:19:09.180Z", "created": "2019-04-22T22:54:25.000Z", "metadata": {"timestamp": "2019-04-22T22:54:25Z", "url": "http://fortune.com/2019/04/16/notre-dame-digital-scan/", "language": "en", "source": "c4", "length": 506}, "subdomain": "c4"}

Locally, the budget includes funding for a feasibility study, to be completed by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, on the potential for an intermodal transit station in Fremont linking BART, the Altamont Commuter Express and AC Transit.\n\u201cI believe such a transfer station will provide commuters more transit alternatives, add convenience and shorten commute times,\u201d Wieckowski said.\nSenator Wieckowski, one of the Legislature\u2019s leading advocates for climate adaptation funding, was instrumental in getting millions into the budget for San Francisco Bay wetlands restoration.\n\u201cThis increased funding for San Francisco Bay wetlands restoration will benefit people and wildlife by accelerating creation of marsh habitat and our region\u2019s adaptation to climate change,\u201d said David Lewis, executive director of Save The Bay.\nThe budget also addresses another Wieckowski priority \u2013 providing low income Californians access to justice \u2013 by making permanent a $10 million funding increase to the Equal Access Fund, which provides financial assistance to legal aid organizations. Legal aid providers help low-income Californians in many ways, including preventing violence by obtaining, renewing and enforcing restraining orders; preserving access to health care; fighting unnecessary foreclosure or repossession; securing unpaid wages; stopping elder abuse; and helping immigrant and blended families. They also step in to resolve their clients\u2019 problems to avoid lawsuits altogether.\nOn healthcare issues, the budget provides $50 million to develop options for universal healthcare and expanding Covered California subsidies. Wieckowski also helped include almost $500,000 to have the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) conduct a literature review and risk assessment on the potential impacts of synthetic food dyes on children.\nMounting scientific evidence suggest that synthetic food dyes contained in child-oriented food products trigger hyperactivity and other behavioral problems in some children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and other behavioral disorders.\nThe CSPI released a report in 2016, Seeing Red: Time for Action on Dyes.

We use it for basic contact forms, all the way through complicated summer camp signup forms, catering to multiple attendees registering for multiple camps. Of course, no system can do everything you want, but Cognito gets close to it for my needs.\nThe company is open to suggestions and ideas, and their technical support is great.\nBuilding the form and publishing works pretty well and is pretty straightforward. I've had one glitch, where I can't seem to change the country (it comes up as US by default for my clients when they enter their address). I would rate Cognito higher if it was easier to copy (and paste) directly from the entries instead of having to create a PDF first.\nLove the product and the support has been amazing!\nIt's made my business life 100% easier... Customer bookings fully automated!\nIt just works! We have tried other form solutions but Cognito is the easiest to use and has been a great addition to our business.\nEasy to use and looks great.\nI love the forms. They aren't the easiest to make but they are the easiest to use, and that's where it counts.\nThe platform is extremely versatile and if you've got a mind geared towards systems - you can get the platform to do what whatever you need it to.\nMy only complaint is that the automated number displayed with the commas in between the numbers, ie. 1,234. I use the Number as an automated number and I would the ability to remove the comma if need be.\nA part from that - I love the system - it is awesome.\nSo far so good.

Very user friendly.\nSimple, effective... just what the doctor ordered!\nAs a 50 member Motorcycle Club we do an annual \u2018charity ride\u2019 to deliver much needed school supplies to impoverished children in the Philippines. This year it fell on me to arrange the event, book hotel rooms and get t-shirt sizes for all those signing up to attend. After designing a website Cognito Forms allowed me to redirect all the Chapter Secretaries to my Form to submit reservations. This worked seamlessly and was a an absolute godsend. It allowed me to set mandatory fields to ensure I collected ALL the data required for everyone - avoiding costly ordering mistakes, time consuming collation of data and potential arguments! CF is a dream to use and worthy of high commendation, especially in our case (as a charitable organisation) where we needed a free option for our first try. Whomever designed CF needs particular praise for keeping it neat, simple and intuitive.\nIt's been great. Would love to see the ability to copy a field from one form to another. For example I have a choose your school field that I has many schools pre populated.

I don\u2019t want to see Canadians hurt.\nIt\u2019s true, however, that, in the artificial universe of trade agreements, previous US leaders have shown they don\u2019t care about US workers. Trump\u2019s the opposite. He\u2019s using American power to muscle deals he believes are beneficial to American workers.\n\u201cCanada is going to have to make some concessions,\u201d says Laura Dawson, head of the Canada Institute at the Woodrow Wilson Centre in Washington, DC. Among them might be raising the threshold at which Canada taxes purchases of American goods from C$20 to around C$1,000, the American level. Canada might consent to more onerous conditions for a vehicle to be imported duty-free within NAFTA, including on wages and the amount of North American content.\nCanada gamely argues that the United States would also be hurt in a trade war. Canada is the biggest destination for exports from 36 of the 50 American states. Bilateral trade in goods and services is immense: $674bn in 2017. It is also, despite what Mr Trump says, balanced. In 2017 the United States had a small surplus with Canada, of $8.4bn. Yet Mr Trudeau\u2019s bargaining position is weak. \u201cWe absolutely need them, but they could live without us,\u201d says Philip Cross, an economist.\nCanada\u2019s system of supply management, which sets limits on the production of dairy, poultry and eggs, has long irritated the United States (and should anger Canadians, who pay more for food than they need to). Canada subjects imports of those products beyond a ceiling to punishing tariffs (298% in the case of butter). Mr Trump has been angry about this since he met dairy farmers from Wisconsin in April 2017.\nThe article is \u201cCanada: Breaking a few eggs: The economy is already feeling the effects of Donald Trump\u2019s trade war,\u201d courtesy of The Economist.\nConservatism once had the genius of James Burnham, Russell Kirk, Frank Chodorov, and Felix Morley; now the brand boasts Rich Lowry, Meghan McCain and S. E. Cupp.\nWhere\u2019s the learning curve? I would not bet on Trump losing a trade war.\nThis is not to advocate tariffs. I am for free trade. But here\u2019s the clincher. We don\u2019t have free-market capitalism. Never have; at least not in recent memory.\nThus, \u201ctrade deficits must be seen in the context of state-managed trade and systemic debt.\u201d That\u2019s what Trump is negotiating; he\u2019s not messing with the divine order in which we true free-marketers believe. For it doesn\u2019t exist.\nAs for Harley-Davidson\u2019s decision to move some of its production outside of the U.S.: Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Kennedy of Fox Business disclosed that the company had been looking to move production off shore for a while and were searching for an excuse to do so.\nA laudable sentiment unreported (except here) was expressed by President Trump, on June 1.\nIt is that the US would be far better off if it negotiated bilateral trade agreements, instead of multilateral deals. Of course, \u201ccounty-on-country\u201d agreements, as the president put it, are preferable to the multilateral maze we currently negotiate.\nIf you can\u2019t have free trade\u2014and we don\u2019t!\u2014smaller and less unwieldy agreements are preferable.\nIf you find a quote, please send it along.

Growing protein demand, especially in Asia Pacific and Latin America, is expected to be a key driver for additive demand over the next six years. In addition, various disease outbreaks in livestock animals such as swine flu and foot & mouth diseases in the past decade have led to increased regulations on meat quality and safety which further has prompted the use of feed additives. Raw material and product cost concerns, especially over specialty products such as enzymes, acidifiers and trace minerals is expected to be a key issue for market participants over the next six years.\nAmino acids such as lysine, methionine, tryptophan and threonine emerged as the leading product segment, accounting for 31.2% of total market revenue in 2012. Amino acids are essential for the growth of animals, especially swine and poultry. Industrial lysine also has advantages over its natural substitute (soybean) which has been driving the global market. Amino acids were followed by antibiotics which accounted for 26.8% of total market revenue in 2012. Antibiotics have been banned in the U.S. and in Europe, and are expected to witness demand primarily from unregulated markets, especially in Asia and Latin America. Feed acidifiers are expected to be the fastest growing products in the overall market, at an estimated CAGR of 6.4% from 2014 to 2020.\nPoultry emerged as the leading livestock consuming feed additives and accounted for 38.2% of total market revenue in 2012. Growing preference for white meat, especially in India and China, is expected to drive poultry feed additive demand over the next six years. Poultry along with being the largest livestock is also expected to be the fastest growing livestock consuming feed additives at an estimated CAGR of 4.2% from 2014 to 2020. Poultry was followed by pork/swine which accounted for just over 30% of total market revenue in 2012.\nAsia Pacific emerged as the leading market for animal feed additives and accounted for 32.6% of total market revenue in 2012. Along with being the largest market, Asia Pacific is also expected to be the fastest growing market for animal feed additives at an estimated CAGR of 4.2% from 2014 to 2020. Increasing domestic demand, coupled with burgeoning meat trade, especially in China and India, is expected to drive the Asian feed additive demand over the next six years.\nEurope animal feed additive demand is expected to reach USD 5,809.7 million by 2020, growing at a CAGR of 4% from 2014 to 2020. Germany was the largest European market, accounting for close to 10% of regional additive demand in 2012.\nThe global animal feed additive market is highly concentrated, with the top four companies including DSM, BASF, Evonik and Danisco. The top four companies accounted for over 60% share of the global animal feed additives market in 2012. Some of the other companies operating in the global market include Elanco, Novozymes, Kemin Industries, Novus International and Cargill among others.", "source": "redpajama", "version": "v1", "added": "2023-04-23T06:27:02.418Z", "created": "2019-04-23T23:25:12.000Z", "metadata": {"timestamp": "2019-04-23T23:25:12Z", "url": "http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/animal-feed-additives-market-anticipated-be-worth-1954-billion-2020-grand-view-research-2032722.htm", "language": "en", "source": "c4", "length": 532}, "subdomain": "c4"}

The CMP is one of the nine subject disciplines that comprise the California Subject Matter Project (CSMP, http://csmp.ucop.edu/). The CSMP is supported by the state of California and is administered by the University of California Office of the President. All CSMP disciplines share common goals and program elements to further their mandate to provide professional and leadership development for K-12 teachers throughout the state.\nOn Monday, December 10, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Jack O\u2019Connell congratulated 251 California teachers for receiving National Board Certification from the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. This brings the total number of California teachers who have achieved this distinction to 3,878. The list of teachers is available at the above Web site, and a searchable directory of National Board Certified Teachers (NBCTs) is available athttp://www.nbpts.org/resources/nbct_directory.\nSixty-three percent of these educators teach in schools that receive federal Title I funds designed to help socioeconomically disadvantaged students succeed academically.\nNational Board Certification is a voluntary assessment program designed to recognize great teachers, reward them, and make them better. While state licensing systems set basic requirements to teach in each state, NBCTs have successfully demonstrated advanced teaching knowledge, skills, and practices. Certification is achieved through a rigorous, performance-based assessment that typically takes one to three years to complete.\nAs part of the process, teachers build a portfolio that includes student work samples, assignments, videotapes, and a thorough analysis of their classroom teaching, including evidence of fairness, equity, and access in meeting student needs. Teachers are also assessed on their knowledge of the subjects they teach.\nAll 50 states, the District of Columbia, and more than 700 local school districts recognize National Board Certification as a mark of distinction and excellence. These municipalities provide valuable incentives to keep the nation\u2019s most accomplished teachers in the classroom. Information about how California school districts are supporting this process is available at http://www.cde.ca.gov/pd/ps/te/nbpts.asp (also see http://www.cde.ca.gov/pd/ps/te/nbptsdistrictsupport.asp for a chart of district incentives).\nFor more information about the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards and National Board Certification, please visit http://www.nbpts.org or contact its California staff members: Kay Garcia (916-428-2068) or Linda Manuel (703-350-7669).\nThe long-awaited report of the National Mathematics Advisory Panel is still very much in flux. Members of the White House-commissioned group staged their 10th, and what was supposed to be their final, meeting in a hotel [in Baltimore, MD on] Nov. 28, though they indicated that numerous revisions to the document are yet to come.\nPresident Bush appointed members of the National Mathematics Advisory Panel in May 2006. He charged its members\u2013who include mathematicians, cognitive psychologists, and those with K-12 teaching experience\u2013to identify promising and effective instructional strategies in mathematics, particularly when it comes to preparing students for algebra, a subject typically taught in 8th or 9th grade.\nOriginally the panel had 17 members, but it now includes 19 individuals, in addition to five ex-officio members from the federal government. One of the original panelists, Nancy Ichinaga, a former California principal, resigned from the panel, and three others have joined the group: Douglas H. Clements, a professor of early childhood, mathematics, and computer education at the University of Buffalo, State University of New York; Susan E. Embreston, a professor of psychology at the Georgia Institute of Technology; and Bert Fristedt, a distinguished teacher of mathematics at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.\nBush administration officials have compared the math panel\u2019s mission to that of the National Reading Panel, an expert group that produced recommendations on reading practices that have had a broad impact on federal policy in that subject-most notably in the awarding of grants through the federal Reading First program. Specifically, administration officials have said the math panel\u2019s advice could guide Math Now, a federal grant program approved by Congress this year, which has not yet been funded.\nThe Eleventh Meeting of the National Mathematics Advisory Panel will be held on December 14-15, 2007 at the Baltimore-Washington International (BWI) Airport Marriott in Baltimore, MD.\nOn Friday, December 14, the Panel will discuss the draft of the Final Report from 3:00 to 6:00 p.m. during an open session.\nOn Saturday, December 15, the Panel will continue its discussion of the draft Final Report during a morning (8:30-11:30 a.m.) and an afternoon (1:00-3:00 p.m.) session.\nIf you would like to provide comments to the National Math Panel, please email written comments, including your contact information to NationalMathPanel@ed.gov by TODAY\u2013Wednesday, December 12, 2007.\nThe twelfth meeting of the National Math Panel will be held in Washington, DC in February 2008.\nA new study funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) found that middle school mathematics teachers in the United States are not as well prepared to teach this challenging subject as are many of their counterparts in five other countries. The findings of this study, Mathematics Teaching in the 21st Century (MT21), conducted by Michigan State University (MSU), were presented yesterday at a news conference at the National Press Club.\n\u201cOur future teachers are getting weak training mathematically and are just not prepared to teach the demanding mathematics curriculum we need for middle schools if we hope to compete internationally in the future,\u201d said William Schmidt, MSU distinguished professor, who directed the study.\nMT21 studied how well a sample of universities and teacher-training institutions prepare middle school mathematics teachers in the United States, South Korea, Taiwan, Germany, Bulgaria and Mexico. Specifically, 2,627 future teachers were surveyed about their preparation, knowledge and beliefs in this subject area.\nThe length of time needed to complete teacher preparation requirements varied among the countries studied. While some of the requirements could be completed within four years, others involved five to seven years of training.\nIn comparison to other countries in the study, U.S. future teachers ranked from the middle to the bottom on MT21 measures of mathematics knowledge.\nThe MT21 findings support previous international research, including the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), also conducted by MSU, which showed low U.S. achievement in mathematics compared to other countries at seventh and eighth grades. Another finding from TIMSS indicated that one of the major factors related to this low performance was a U.S. middle school curriculum that was unfocused, lacking coherence and not particularly demanding or rigorous.\n\u2014 Future U.S. middle school teachers\u2019 mathematics knowledge was generally weaker than that of future teachers in South Korea, Taiwan, Germany, and (in some areas) Bulgaria. Taiwanese and South Korean future teachers were the top performers in all five areas of mathematics knowledge.\n\u2014 The best subject area for future teachers in the U.S. was statistics knowledge, where they performed near the international average.\n\u2014 Taiwanese and South Korean future teachers typically covered about 80 percent or more of advanced mathematics topics in their training, while those in Mexico and the U.S. covered less than 50 percent.\n\u2014 In the practical aspect of teaching, the extent of coverage for U.S. future teachers was also substantially less than that provided by Taiwan and South Korea.\n\u2014 Future U.S. middle school mathematics teachers in the study are trained in three kinds of programs: secondary programs, elementary programs and those that directly prepare middle school teachers.\n\u2014 Those that prepare as secondary teachers have a stronger mathematics preparation. Those that prepare as elementary teachers have stronger teaching skill preparation. Those that prepare as middle school teachers seem to have the worst of both of these programs.\nLast week, females swept the top prizes in America\u2019s premier high school science competition for the first time in its nine-year history in the 2007-08 Siemens Competition in Math, Science and Technology. These science superstars will ring The Closing Bell at the New York Stock Exchange in February.\nThe prestigious Siemens Competition, a signature program of the Siemens Foundation, is administered by the College Board. The ninth annual awards were presented on December 3 at New York University, host of the Siemens Competition National Finals.\n$100,000 scholarship in the individual category for research on bone growth and our ability to treat bone injuries and disorders. Janelle Schlossberger and Amanda Marinoff, seniors at Plainview-Old Bethpage John F. Kennedy High School in Plainview, New York, won the $100,000 prize in the team category, which they will share equally, for a drug discovery project that could lead to the first new tuberculosis treatment in 35 years.\nThe national finals were judged by a panel of nationally renowned scientists and mathematicians headed by lead judge Dr. Joseph Taylor, winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics and James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Physics, Emeritus, Princeton University. Twenty national finalists competed in the national finals, including six individuals and six teams. The finalists previously competed last month in a series of regional competitions held at six leading research universities: California Institute of Technology; Carnegie Mellon University; Georgia Institute of Technology; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; University of Notre Dame; and the University of Texas at Austin.\nThe Siemens Foundation, established in 1998, is a national leader in math and science education, providing more than $2 million in scholarships and awards annually. Based in Iselin, New Jersey, the Foundation\u2019s signature programs\u2013the Siemens Competition in Math, Science & Technology, the Siemens Awards for Advanced Placement, and the Siemens Teacher Scholarships\u2013recognize exceptional achievement in science, math and technology. By supporting outstanding students today, and recognizing the teachers and schools that inspire their excellence, the Foundation helps nurture tomorrow\u2019s scientists and engineers. For more information, please visitwww.siemens-foundation.org.\n\u2026The Siemens competition was first held in 1998 and is distinct from the Westinghouse Science Talent Search, which was founded in 1941 and is now known as the Intel Science Talent Search. Many high school students enter both.\nThe Siemens Foundation Founder\u2019s Award is an annual monetary award of $15,000 given in recognition of an individual or school for efforts to encourage students to participate in math, science or technology research programs and to provide support consistent with the Siemens Foundation\u2019s mission of enhancing math and science in American high schools.\nThe 2007-08 winner of the Siemens Foundation Founder\u2019s Award is Mathworks, which is a center for innovation in mathematics education at Texas State University. The mission of Mathworks is to develop model programs and self-sustaining learning communities that engage Texas K-12 students from all backgrounds in doing mathematics at a high level. Summer math camps and after-school programs include undergraduate counselors mentored by more experienced math teachers, who themselves are being trained as teacher-leaders for their districts.\nFrom 2001-2004, Mathworks sent the first U. S. teams ever to compete in the Primary Math World Contest in Hong Kong. Mathworks teams again participated in 2006, and won the Po Leung Kuk Cup as the top non-Asian team for the 4th time. Fifty-six Mathworks students have been named Siemens-Westinghouse semi-finalists over the past six years and 6 students (2 teams) were named national finalists.\nVisit http://www.txstate.edu/mathworks/ for more details about Mathworks and its programs.", "source": "redpajama", "version": "v1", "added": "2023-04-23T06:31:32.580Z", "created": "2019-04-26T16:24:14.000Z", "metadata": {"timestamp": "2019-04-26T16:24:14Z", "url": "https://cmpso.org/comet-vol-8-no-32-12-december-2007/", "language": "en", "source": "c4", "length": 1839}, "subdomain": "c4"}

This is the age when required minimum distributions must be taken. RMDs need to be taken from IRAs, 401(k)s and other retirement accounts.\nHere are 7 things you need to know about required minimum distributions.\nThe rules were changed a number of years ago to require custodians such as Schwab and Fidelity to report the amount of your annual required minimum distribution to the government. In the past this had not been the case. This was part of an effort to enforce the taking of these distributions and the payment of the taxes associated with them. The penalty for not taking an RMD is steep, 50% of the amount not taken in addition to paying the taxes due.\nAs an example, if your RMD is $20,000 and you don\u2019t take it you would owe a penalty of $10,000 on top of the taxes associated with the $20,000 distribution from your retirement account.\nIf you have multiple retirement accounts you will likely receive a separate RMD amount for each account. Note that the total of your required minimum distributions is what counts, you can generally take the entire amount of the distribution all from one account or from some or all of your various accounts as long as the total amount taken is correct. There are exceptions to this, so be sure to check with your custodian or a qualified tax or financial advisor to ensure you take the correct amounts for all accounts as require..\nYour first required minimum distribution will be for the year in which you turn 70 \u00bd. For example, if you turned 70 on January 1, 2019 you will be 70 \u00bd on July 1, 2019 and you would have a required distribution for the current calendar year, 2019.\nIf your birthday is September 1, 2019, your first distribution is not required until 2020 since that\u2019s when you turn 70 \u00bd.\nFor your initial RMD only, you are not required to take the distribution until April 1 of the calendar year following the year in which you turn 70 \u00bd. For the someone turning 70 on January 1, 2019 that would be April 1, 2020, for someone reaching age 70 on September 1, 2019 their initial RMD could be deferred until April 1, 2021.\nHowever, all subsequent RMDs must be taken by December 31 of the appropriate year. Delaying the initial distribution until April 1 of the following calendar year would mean that you would be taking two distributions and paying taxes on both for the same calendar year. Often for this reason I suggest taking the first distribution in the year that it applies to, for example by December 31, 2019 in the January 1, 2019 birthday example. This chart might make this a bit easier to follow.\nHow on earth is this calculated?\nYour required minimum distribution for a given year is calculated based upon your age and the total of your retirement account(s) at December 31 of the prior year. The calculation is based upon the tables in IRS Publication 590.\nFor example if you are 75, married with a spouse who is not more than 10 years younger than you, and your IRA account balance was $500,000 at the end of 2018, your RMD for 2019 would be approximately $21,834 using the table. I generally rely on calculations by the custodian for a number of reasons, but it is always a good idea to double check. There are a number of online RMD calculators including this one.\nIf you are 70 \u00bd or older and still working, there is a specific exception to the RMD rule. This pertains only to the 401(k) or similar retirement plan of your current employer. Additionally, it only applies if you are less than a 5% owner of the company. If both conditions are satisfied you do not have to take an RMD on that plan. Any other IRAs, an old 401(k), or similar accounts will still have a required minimum distribution. Your company must elect to offer this exception, so it is best to check with your retirement plan administrator if you are in this situation.\nInherited IRAs are a specific type of account that usually comes into play with a non-spousal beneficiary. As an example, a parent who is a widow or widower might leave their IRA account to their adult children.\nLet\u2019s say the mother is a widow with a $100,000 IRA and she names each of her two adult children as beneficiaries. Upon her death each child would have some options including setting up an inherited IRA account which has some specific rules.\nIf the mother had already started taking required minimum distributions from her IRA, then the children would need to continue taking RMDs from their inherited IRA accounts. However, their distributions would be based upon their life expectancy tables resulting in smaller distributions then would have been required by their mother. This allows the kids is to preserve and grow the inherited IRA account.\nOne of the major benefits of a Roth IRA account is that the owner is not required to take required minimum distributions. This might be a factor among many in deciding whether a Roth IRA is the right way to go.\nNote inherited Roth IRAs have different rules for non-spousal beneficiaries. If this is your situation you should contact a financial advisor who understands this issue.\nCertainly, this list is not an exhaustive list. Required minimum distributions play an important part in both your retirement planning and potentially your estate planning. If you have questions, make sure you contact a tax or financial advisor who understands this complex area.\nIn or approaching retirement and want another opinion on where you stand? Not sure if your investments are right for your situation? Need help getting on track? Check out my Financial Review/Second Opinion for Individuals service for detailed guidance and advice about your situation.\nThanksgiving is behind us and we are in the home stretch of 2013. While your thoughts might be on shopping and getting ready for the holidays, there are a number of financial planning tasks that still need your attention. Here are 7 financial planning tips for the end of the year.\nThis only works with investments held in a taxable account.\nThis is not a good strategy for investments in which you have an unrealized loss. Here it is better to sell the investment, realize the loss and donate the cash.\nThe thought here is to review investments held in taxable accounts and sell all or some of them with unrealized losses. These may be a bit harder to come by this year given the appreciation in the stock market. Bond funds and other fixed income investments might be your best bet here.\nThe benefit of this strategy is that realized losses can be offset against capital gains to mitigate the tax due. There are a number of nuances to be aware of here, including the Wash Sale Rules, so be sure you\u2019ve done your research and/or consulted with your tax or financial advisor before proceeding.\nIf you are self-employed and haven\u2019t done so already consider opening a Solo 401(k) account. The Solo 401(k) can be an excellent retirement planning vehicle for the self-employed. If you want to contribute for 2013 the account must be opened by December 31. You then have until the date that you file your tax return, including extensions, to make your 2013 contributions.\nWith the tremendous gains in the stock market so far this year, your portfolio might be overly allocated to equities if you haven\u2019t rebalanced lately. The problem with letting your equity allocation just run with the market is that you may be taking more risk than you had intended or more than is appropriate for your situation.\nRebalance with a total portfolio view. Use tax-deferred accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s to your best advantage. Donating appreciated investments to charity can help. You can also use new money to shore up under allocated portions of your portfolio to reduce the need to sell winners.\nThis is the time of the year when many companies update their 401(k) investment menus both by adding new investment options and replacing some funds with new choices. This often coincides with the open enrollment process for employee benefits and is a good time for you to review any changes and update your investment choices if appropriate.\nMany mutual fund companies issue distributions from the funds for dividends and capital gains around the end of the year. These distributions are based upon owning the fund on the date the distribution is declared. If you are not careful you could be the recipient of a distribution even though you\u2019ve only owned the fund for a short time. You would be fully liable for any taxes due on this distribution. This of course only pertains to mutual fund investments made in taxable accounts.\nIf you are 70 \u00bd or older you are required to take a minimum distribution from your IRAs and other retirement accounts. The amount required is based upon your account balance as of the end of the prior year and is based on IRS tables. Account custodians are required to calculate your RMD and report this amount to the IRS.\nNote beneficiaries of inherited IRAs may also be required to take an RMD if the deceased individual was taking RMDs at the time of his/her death.\nIf you have multiple accounts with multiple custodians you need to take a total distribution based upon all of these accounts, though you can pick and choose from which accounts you\u2019d like to take the distribution. Make sure to take your distribution by the end of the year otherwise you will be faced with a stiff penalty of 50% of the amount you did not take on top of the income taxes normally due.\nIf you turned 70 \u00bd this year you can delay your first distribution to April 1 of next year, but that means that you will need to take two distributions next year with the corresponding tax liability. Also if you are still working and are not a 5% or greater owner of your company you do not need to take a distribution from your 401(k) with that employer. You do, however, need to take the distribution on all remaining retirement accounts.\nFor those who take required minimum distributions and who are otherwise charitably inclined, you have the option of diverting some or all of your distribution via a provision called the qualified charitable distribution (QCD). The advantage is that this portion of your RMD is not treated as a taxable income and may have a favorable impact on the amount of Social Security that is subject to income taxes for 2014 and other potential benefits. Note that you can\u2019t double dip and also take this as a deductible charitable contribution. Consult with the custodian of your IRA or retirement plan for the logistics of executing this transaction.\nWith all of the strategies mentioned above I recommend that you consult with a qualified tax or financial advisor to ensure that the strategy is right for your unique situation and if so that you execute it properly.\nCertainly year-end is about the holidays, family, friends, food, and football. It is also a great time to take execute some final year-end financial planning moves that can have a big payoff and in the case of RMDs save you from some hefty penalties.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December of 2017 marks the biggest overhaul in the tax code in many years. One area that will be impacted under tax reform is charitable giving.\nWhile charitable contributions remain eligible as an itemized deduction under tax reform, the ability to actually deduct your contributions may have been impacted by some changes in in the rules. Here are some thoughts for this holiday season and throughout the year.\nTax reform may impact your ability to itemize deductions including charitable contributions.\nSALT stands for state and local taxes. Tax reform capped the amount of these taxes that can be used as an itemized deduction at $10,000 for 2018 going forward. The two biggest SALT components for most people are their state income taxes and their property taxes. This will especially impact those people living in states with high income taxes and locations with high property values/property taxes. Many commentators say this was politically motivated since taxpayers in \u201cblue states\u201d seem to be disproportionately impacted, I\u2019ll leave that to you the reader to decide.\nThe other major change that may impact your ability to itemize deductions is the increase in the standard deduction. Starting in 2018, the standard deduction increases to $24,000 for those who are married filing jointly and $12,000 for single filers. This means that if your itemized deductions are less than these thresholds, you will be better off taking the standard deduction versus itemizing.\nNote that these and most provisions under tax reform expire after the 2025 tax year, so we will see what the future holds for these and other provisions beyond that.\nThe deductibility of charitable contributions was not eliminated under tax reform, in fact it was expanded for some high-income taxpayers. The issue for many taxpayers is whether or not they can still itemize deductions with the changes to the standard deduction limits and the SALT cap discussed above.\nFor those whose situation might not allow them to itemize, here are some ways to make your charitable giving more tax-efficient.\nLet\u2019s say that you and your spouse file a joint return. In this example let\u2019s say your mortgage interest is $10,000 for the year and your SALT taxes are capped at the $10,000 level. With other deductible expenses your itemized deductions would come to $21,500, leaving you $3,500 short of the $24,000 standard deduction threshold.\nOne option would be to bunch expenses that would qualify as itemized deductions into 2018 (or any appropriate year) to get over the $24,000 hurdle.\nIn the case of charitable contributions, you might consider making additional contributions in the current tax year to help your reach the threshold where you can itemize. If you normally would make contributions of $1,500 per year and can afford to do so, you might try to make 2-3 years\u2019 worth of contributions to the organizations of your choice in the current year to get your deductions above the threshold.\nUsing appreciated securities held in a taxable account to make charitable contributions has long been an excellent method to make charitable contributions. Stocks, mutual funds and ETFs that have appreciated in value are good gifts. Other types of appreciated assets can be used as well, such as art, collectibles and real estate. These types of assets will need to have an appraisal to determine their value as a gift, versus using the market value on the day of the gift for appreciated securities.\nThe value of the gift can be deducted as a charitable contribution for those who can itemize deductions.\nThere are no capital gains taxes that will be due on the contributed shares. If you were to sell the shares first and then contribute the cash, you would owe capital gains taxes on the amount of the realized gain on the sale.\nThis strategy can also be used as part of your overall portfolio rebalancing, it can be a tax-efficient way to rebalance your holdings.\nEven for those who cannot itemize under the new rules, the benefit of not having to pay taxes on the capital gains can be a significant benefit.\nIf you have a security that has declined in value, you are generally better off selling it, realizing a loss on the sale and then contributing the cash.\nIf this is a route that is appropriate for you, be sure to contact the organization to ensure that they can accept gifts of appreciated securities or other types of assets.\nUsing appreciated securities held in a taxable account to make charitable contributions has long been an excellent method to make charitable contributions.\nA donor-advised fund is a fund that allows you to have your contributions to the fund professionally managed, offering the opportunity to make contributions to qualified charitable organizations over time. DAFs have been around for many years and are offered by such big-name financial services organizations like Vanguard, Schwab and Fidelity among others.\nAfter establishing your account, contributions to the DAF can be made via check, securities or other assets. The details may vary a bit from fund to fund.\nThe fund invests your contributions professionally, typically through a list of individual funds or several managed portfolios they might offer. The money grows, and contributions can be made over time to the organization(s) of your choosing, as long as they are qualified charities. Most DAFs have minimum initial and future contribution levels, as well as minimum donation levels.\nDAFs fit well into the new tax environment in that they can accept appreciated securities and can be a great vehicle to bunch your contributions in order to be able to itemize in certain years. They also allow you to space out your charitable donations if your desire is to give a certain amount each year.\nFor those who are age 70 \u00bd or older, you can direct some or all of your required minimum distribution (RMD) to a qualified charitable organization each year in what is called a qualified charitable distribution (QCD). The limit is $100,000 annually.\nThe QCD has been around for a number of years. The amount directed to the charity is not taxed. This is beneficial for many reasons, including keeping your income in a range that offers the lowest future Medicare costs.\nThe amount of the QCD does not qualify as a deductible charitable contribution. If you have charitable intentions, this can be a tax-efficient way to make charitable.\nContributing to charity is a great thing to do for those of us who are able to do it. As a Jesuit priest told me back in my graduate school days at Marquette University, you might as well take any tax breaks possible when making donations. The ideas above can help make your contributions a bit more tax-efficient.\nAs with any tax or financial planning issue, be sure to consult with a qualified tax or financial professional to determine if these ideas make sense for your situation.", "source": "redpajama", "version": "v1", "added": "2023-04-23T07:49:33.962Z", "created": "2019-04-26T16:02:00.000Z", "metadata": {"timestamp": "2019-04-26T16:02:00Z", "url": "https://thechicagofinancialplanner.com/?s=required+minimum+distributions", "language": "en", "source": "c4", "length": 3122}, "subdomain": "c4"}
